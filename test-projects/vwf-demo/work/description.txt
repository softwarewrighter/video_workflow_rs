5 Things About VWF - The Video Workflow Framework

Ever struggle with AI agents forgetting steps or making up parameters? VWF solves this by making workflows explicit data, not remembered instructions.

In this short, we cover:
- Workflows as Data (YAML, not memory)
- Dependency DAG (parallel when safe)
- Placeholders (progress without all assets)
- Checkpoints (human review points)
- Incremental Builds (only redo what changed)
