# VWF Demo Narration

## 00-intro
Five things you need to know about VWF, the Video Workflow Framework.

## 01-workflows-as-data
First, workflows are data. Your video pipeline lives in a YAML file, not in an agent's memory. No more forgotten steps or hallucinated parameters.

## 02-dependency-dag
Second, it uses a dependency graph. Tasks run when their inputs are ready. Safe to parallelize? It runs them together. Must be sequential? It waits.

## 03-placeholders
Third, placeholders keep you moving. Missing your background image? VWF uses a solid color. Missing intro video? It skips it. You see progress immediately.

## 04-checkpoints
Fourth, checkpoints for human review. Before generating audio, you review the text. Before final render, you check the preview. No wasted compute on wrong content.

## 05-incremental
Fifth, incremental builds. Change your background? Only the affected steps re-run. Your TTS stays cached. Minutes saved on every iteration.

## 06-cta
