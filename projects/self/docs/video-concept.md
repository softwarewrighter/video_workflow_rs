# VWF Self-Explainer Video

Explainer video demonstrating the Video Workflow Framework (VWF) itself - a meta/self-referential video showing how the tool creates its own explainer.

## Video Concept

Target: 2-3 minute landscape explainer for Behind the Build / ToonTalk series.

### Key Topics
- "Workflows are data, runner is code" principle
- YAML-driven video production
- Agent drift elimination through deterministic execution
- Resume capability with `--resume` flag
- TTS integration and audio normalization

### Narrative Hook

"What if the tool that makes explainer videos... made a video about itself?"

## Prior Work

This project incorporates content from vwf-demo:
- HTML slides in `showcase/slides/`
- Narration scripts in `work/scripts/`
- Outline in `work/slides-outline.txt`

## Status

**Status:** Planning
