      DESCRIPTION:
      A tiny demo of how still frames become a crisp script.
      We extract structure, then generate tight narration.
      Finally we validate format and save to work/.

      NARRATION:
      Here are the stills. First, we identify what the viewer sees and what they need next.
      Then we write narration that matches the visuals—no extra lore, no invented facts.
      Last, we save drafts so a stronger model can review and polish.

      Next:
      - Review work/description.txt and work/narration.txt
      - If good, feed to a “cloud reviewer” workflow that enforces style + avoids repetition
