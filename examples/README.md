# Examples

- `workflows/shorts_narration.yaml`: stills → drafts
- `workflows/explainer_outline.yaml`: repo notes → outline

Put your inputs under the chosen workdir, e.g.:

```
work/demo/
  inputs/stills/   (png/jpg)
```

The engine itself treats inputs as opaque files; your workflow defines how they are used.
